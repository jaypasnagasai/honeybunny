## Introduction

The `honey_bunny` function is designed to loop through a range of numbers and apply specific rules to certain multiples. It can be useful for generating sequences of numbers where multiples of two given numbers are replaced with corresponding words. This can be particularly fun when using words like "Honey" and "Bunny" for replacements.

## Usage

To use the `honey_bunny` function, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or copy the code from [`honey_bunny.py`](honey_bunny.py).
2. Run the script in your preferred Python environment.
3. Follow the prompts to provide inputs for the function parameters, including range limits, numbers for special handling, and replacement words.

## Parameters

The `honey_bunny` function requires the following parameters:

- `lower_limit`: The lower limit of the range of numbers.
- `upper_limit`: The upper limit of the range of numbers.
- `num1`: The first number whose multiples need special handling.
- `num2`: The second number whose multiples need special handling.
- `honey_word`: The word to be used for multiples of `num1`.
- `bunny_word`: The word to be used for multiples of `num2`.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `honey_bunny` function:

```python
from honey_bunny import honey_bunny

lower_limit = 1
upper_limit = 20
num1 = 3
num2 = 5
honey_word = "Fizz"
bunny_word = "Buzz"

honey_bunny(lower_limit, upper_limit, num1, num2, honey_word, bunny_word)

Running the above code will generate a sequence of numbers with special replacements for multiples of num1 and num2 based on the provided words.
